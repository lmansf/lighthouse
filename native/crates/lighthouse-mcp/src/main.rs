//! `lighthouse-mcp` — the Lighthouse MCP server (openspec: add-automation §3).
//!
//! An MCP server over STDIO (JSON-RPC 2.0 on stdin/stdout), IN-PROCESS against
//! `lighthouse-core` — NOT shelling `lighthouse-server`. Its tools therefore
//! inherit the engine's ask chokepoint directly: `ask_vault` answers through
//! `ask::run_headless_ask`, so it is audited + egress-attributed exactly like an
//! app ask, and there is a single answer path to reason about (no second
//! transport to re-audit or secure). See `protocol` for the wire handling and
//! the §3.5 transport-posture note, and `tools` for the read-only-leaning v1
//! tool set (`ask_vault`, `list_files`, `list_investigations`,
//! `run_analytics_sql`) — no vault- or store-mutating tool ships in v1.
//!
//! §3.5 (detailed in `protocol`): v1 is STDIO ONLY — no listening port, hence no
//! network-auth surface. A future port MUST bind loopback and adopt `auth.rs`'s
//! loopback-host allowlist + same-port origin + `LIGHTHOUSE_API_TOKEN`.
//!
//! PARITY: this binary is Rust ENTRY PLUMBING (the same category as `ask.rs` and
//! the `lighthouse` CLI, and the desktop shell / headless server) — it has NO
//! `src/server` twin. Only the engine functions its tools call (`run_headless_ask`,
//! `vault::list_nodes`, `investigations::listing`, `analytics::run_direct`) carry
//! the twin obligation; there is no headless/MCP ask surface in the TS engine (the
//! app is the only entry). See docs/ts-twin.md.
